# Post-Quantum Cryptography in TypeScript

[![tests](https://github.com/dark-bio/crypto-ts/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dark-bio/crypto-ts/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repository is parameter selection and lightweight wrapper around a number of (WASM wrapped) Rust cryptographic libraries. Its purpose isn't to implement primitives, rather to unify the API surface of existing libraries; limited to the tiny subset needed by the Dark Bio project.

The library is opinionated. Parameters and primitives were selected to provide matching levels of security in a post-quantum world. APIs were designed to make the library easy to use and hard to misuse. Flexibility will always be rejected in favor of safety.

- Certificates
    - **x509 ([RFC-5280](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280))**: `xDSA`, `xHPKE`
- Digital signatures
    - **xDSA ([RFC-DRAFT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs))**: `MLDSA`, `EdDSA`, `SHA512`
        - **EdDSA ([RFC-8032](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8032))**: `Ed25519`
        - **MLDSA ([RFC-DRAFT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-lamps-dilithium-certificates))**: Security level 3 (`ML-DSA-65`)
    - **RSA ([RFC-8017](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8017))**: 2048-bit, `SHA256`
- Encryption
    - **xHPKE ([RFC-9180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9180))**: `X-WING`, `HKDF`, `SHA256`, `ChaCha20`, `Poly1305`
        - **X-WING ([RFC-DRAFT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem))**: `MLKEM`, `ECC`
            - **ECC ([RFC-7748](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7748))**: `X25519`
            - **MLKEM([RFC-DRAFT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-mlkem))**: Security level 3 (`ML-KEM-768`)
    - **STREAM (*RFC N/A*, [Rage](https://github.com/str4d/rage))**: `ChaCha20`, `Poly1305`, `16B` tag, `64KB` chunk
- Key derivation
    - **Argon2 ([RFC-9106](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9106))**: `id` variant
    - **HKDF ([RFC-5869](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5869))**: `SHA256`
- Serialization
    - **CBOR¹ ([RFC-8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949))**: restricted to `bool`,`null`, `integer`, `text`, `bytes`, `array`, `map[int]`, `option`
    - **COSE ([RFC-8152](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152))**: `COSE_Sign1`, `COSE_Encrypt0`, `dark-bio-v1:` domain prefix

*¹ As CBOR encoding/decoding would require a full reimplementation in TypeScript, that is delegated to any preferred 3rd party library. To ensure correctness, this package provides a `cbor.verify`, which it also implicitly enforces that when crossing through `cose`.*

## Native packages

The underlying implementation exists in two sibling repos, which track the same feature set and API surfaces, released at corresponding version points.

- Rust [`github.com/dark-bio/crypto-rs`](https://github.com/dark-bio/crypto-rs)
- Go [`github.com/dark-bio/crypto-go`](https://github.com/dark-bio/crypto-go)

Sibling wrapper exists in one other repo:

- Flutter [`github.com/dark-bio/crypto-fl`](https://github.com/dark-bio/crypto-fl)

## Acknowledgements

Shoutout to Filippo Valsorda ([@filosottile](https://github.com/filosottile)) for lots of tips and nudges on what kind of cryptographic primitives to use and how to combine them properly; and also for his work in general on cryptography standards.

Naturally, many thanks to the authors of all the libraries this project depends on.
